        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <h2><div class="contact">Here at Primavera we pride ourselves at being able to make fresh, organic, farm to table meals. 
            Our fully vegetarian restaurant can guarantee you that not a single animal is harmed in the process of making our food. 
            We employ staff who not only care about your experience but the quality of your food they serve. Primavera also reduces waste as much as we can by 
            composting food waste and using high quality cookware and dishes in order to reduce breakage over consumption. Each morning our trusted suppliers deliver 
            all the fresh produce straight from our local farms. The food is prepared by our talented chefs and served throughout the day.
            <br>

            We started out as a small cafe from inside a bookstore filled with a passion to spread vegetarian love and help educate our community on vegetarianism and veganism.  
            Our efforts at community outreach strengthened our business and we soon had many regulars. With time we crafted a menu containing the best vegetarian comfort food that our regulars love. With the help of fellow vegetarian supporters we have been able to open multiple stores in the area. We hope to continue expanding business and spreading vegetarian culture through good food.
